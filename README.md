# üõí Global Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard
---

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes profitability, customer behavior, and logistics performance across Global Superstore‚Äôs international operations between 2011 and 2014. The goal was to uncover actionable insights that could guide smarter decisions around pricing, product strategy, and market expansion.

Using Power BI, I explored over 10,000 product-level transactions across 147 countries, grouped into three main categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology. The analysis simulates a real-world scenario where a business analyst is expected to present data-backed recommendations to improve performance.
